# Pseudo Code

# assign class to file based on the program run
# parse the file according to the 'program' class looking for that class's specific variables

# add all variables to a spreadsheet with appropriate columns

# each data file should 


# enter data file to be read
# enter archive to cycle through
# read txt files and check if they are mpc data files
# find marker in data file such as program name
