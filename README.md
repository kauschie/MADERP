# MADERP
Mike and Amy Data Extraction and Retrieval Program

Project Terminated around July 2021

Project Conception:
  - Dr. Gancarz-Kausch came to me and requested a way of backing up old data files generated from her Med-Associates
    operant chambers.
  - Needed a way of extracting and archiving data from all of her experiments
  - This program successfully extracts the data from the files and archives it in a simple mysql database

Reason for termination:
  - Med Associates came out with and released their own data retrieval tool :(
  - Systems old windows based systems that didn't have python installed and she lacked administrative privileges
  - Going back to school and need to focus on c++ for class, if this project still shows merit then I will reassess
    its design and implementation at a later date.
